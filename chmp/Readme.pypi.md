# chmp - Support code for machine learning / data science experiments

A collection of utility functions I regularly use in my machine learning / data
science experiments or prototypes. While this package is mostly geared towards 
personal use, it may be helpful to others as well.

For docs / examples see [the repository](https://github.com/chmp/misc-exp).
